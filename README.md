Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering is important because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including commerce, healthcare, entertainment, and communication

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Development of programming languages, for example Fortran
b) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline. This happened in the 1960s
c) The advent of structured programming which happened in the 1970s
d) The rise of agile methodologies which happened in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
b) Design: This involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
c) Implementation: This involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
d) Testing: This involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and function requirements
e) Deployment: This involves releasing the software to users or customers
f) Maintenance: This involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall, for example, phases such as requirements, design, and implementation while agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a 
Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software Developer- writes code and implements software solutions.
b) Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) Project Manager- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-they are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
b) Version Control Systems (VCS)- they are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git, and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Changing requirements during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays
b) Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions which can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
c) Tight Deadlines pressure software engineers to deliver software products on schedule and this can lead to rushed development and compromised quality.

Strategies to overcome these challenges include:
a) Effective communication
b) Agile methodologies
c) Tasks prioritization
d) Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit Testing- This involves testing individual components or modules of software
b) Integration Testing- This involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems
c) System  Testing- This involves testing the entire software as a whole
d) Acceptance Testing- This involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of testing:
It helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from an AI model. It's important because it helps you create clear and specific questions so that AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Translate this sentence
Improved prompt: Translate this English sentence to French
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear and specific to which language I want the English sentence to be translated to
